Extension to combat common social media scam messages. | Capstone project 2021-2022 year.

# How does it work?
When functionality starts being developed, all a user will have to do is click on the extension's icon to have it run, and check any messages present on the current page. The extension will use a database of known messages per site and challenge scanned messages to the site's database.

# Does it work yet?
lmao no

# What does it do as of current commit?
Gives user a simple instruction page upon installation, that's about it.
